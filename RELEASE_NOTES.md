# Release Notes

## v0.1.0 — CommandCode Go/GOAT/Pro/Max provider

First release of the plugin as a CommandCode Go/GOAT/Pro/Max provider, derived from
opencode-go-cliproxyapi v0.1.7.

**Adaptations**

- **Reasoning preservation**: upstream `reasoning`, `reasoning_details[].text`
  and `reasoning_content` are read together (mirrored values counted once) and
  emitted as a leading Claude `thinking` block, a leading Responses `reasoning`
  item with summary events, or a backfilled `reasoning_content` on the OpenAI
  passthrough — streaming and non-streaming.
- **Chat-completions-only routing**: every catalog model defaults to
  `{base-url}/chat/completions`, because CommandCode's `/messages` endpoint
  accepts Claude models only and `/responses` is not registered. The family
  prefix table was removed; `route-overrides` remain for other upstreams.
- **Effort passthrough**: models without thinking metadata (all CommandCode
  models) are no longer validated or clamped locally — `xhigh`/`max` reach the
  upstream verbatim, `auto`/`none` omit the field. A model that declares levels
  or bounds opts back into eager validation.
- **Quota page against the real account API**: cards show account email, plan,
  remaining plan credits, and the rolling 5-hour/weekly windows from
  `/alpha/billing/credits`, `/alpha/billing/subscriptions` and `/alpha/whoami`.
- Defaults renamed (`commandcode` prefix, `api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1`
  base URL, `commandcode-go-cliproxyapi` plugin id).

**Upgrade notes**

- The provider namespace changed, so client model ids must be updated
  (for example `commandcode/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`).
- Replace the plugin binary, restart CLIProxyAPI, and hard-refresh the
  Management Center.
